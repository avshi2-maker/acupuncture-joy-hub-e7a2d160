Grief Symptom,Tongue Signs,Pulse Signs,TCM Pattern,Mechanism/Notes
"Sadness, tearfulness, feeling like crying","Pale tongue (overall or front 1/3 area), thin coating, possibly dry","Weak, thin, empty pulse in right cun position (Lung)",Lung Qi Deficiency,Lung houses Po (corporeal soul) and governs grief emotion. Front third of tongue = Lung/Heart area. Right cun pulse = Lung position.
"Fatigue, low energy, weakness","Pale, possibly swollen tongue body, thin white coating","Weak, deficient pulse overall, especially right cun (Lung) and right guan (Spleen)",Lung-Spleen Qi Deficiency,"Grief depletes Lung Qi, which fails to support Spleen. Pale = Qi/Blood deficiency. Weak pulse at depth = interior deficiency."
"Shallow breathing, chest tightness","Pale or normal body, thin coating, may have slight purple tinge indicating stagnation","Tight or slightly wiry pulse in right cun (Lung), may be weak",Lung Qi Deficiency with constraint,Lung unable to descend and disperse Qi. Tight pulse = obstruction/pain. Front 1/3 tongue corresponds to chest/upper jiao.
"Weak voice, low speaking volume","Pale tongue, especially front third, scanty coating","Weak, thin pulse in right cun (Lung), lacks force",Lung Qi Deficiency,Lung governs voice and speech. Pale tip/front = Heart-Lung weakness. Weak cun pulse = upper jiao Qi deficiency.
"Frequent colds, lowered immunity","Pale tongue overall, thin white coating","Floating but weak pulse in right cun (Lung), lacks root",Wei Qi Deficiency (Lung Qi deficiency),"Lung produces Wei Qi. Floating pulse normally indicates exterior, but weak = deficiency allowing invasion. Spontaneous sweating may accompany."
Spontaneous daytime sweating,"Pale, moist tongue with thin coating","Floating weak pulse in right cun, empty quality",Lung Qi Deficiency - Wei Qi not consolidating exterior,Wei Qi fails to secure exterior. Empty pulse = Qi/Yang deficiency. Moisture on tongue = fluids not properly regulated.
"Palpitations, rapid heartbeat","Red tip (if Heart Fire) OR pale tip (if Heart Qi deficiency), possible trembling",Rapid pulse in left cun (Heart) - if excess; or weak rapid if deficiency,Heart Qi Deficiency or Heart-Fire disturbing Shen,Tongue tip = Heart. Red tip = heat/fire. Pale tip = deficiency. Left cun = Heart position. Rapid = heat or anxiety affecting Heart.
"Insomnia, difficulty falling asleep",Red tip with scanty coating (Yin def) OR pale with normal coating (Qi def),"Thin, rapid pulse in left cun (Heart) if Yin def; weak pulse if Qi def",Heart-Yin Deficiency or Heart-Lung Qi Deficiency,Shen not rooted. Red tip + no coating = Yin deficiency heat. Pale = Qi deficiency unable to nourish Shen. Thin rapid = Yin def.
"Anxiety, restlessness, feeling on edge","Red tongue tip, may have red points, possible heart area cracks","Wiry and rapid pulse in left cun (Heart), may be thin",Heart-Fire or Shen disturbance,"Grief transforms to agitation. Red tip = Heart Fire. Cracks in center = Heart Yin damage. Wiry = constraint, rapid = heat."
"Poor memory, mental fog, confusion","Pale tongue body, swollen, possible teeth marks, thin coating",Weak pulse in left cun (Heart) and right guan (Spleen),Heart-Spleen Deficiency,"Heart houses Shen (cognition), Spleen houses Yi (thought). Both depleted. Swollen with teeth marks = Spleen Qi deficiency with dampness."
"Vivid dreams, nightmares, disturbed sleep","Red tip or sides, may be normal body with red tip",Wiry or rapid pulse in left cun (Heart),Heart-Fire or Liver-Fire harassing Shen,Excessive dreaming = Shen unsettled. Red sides = Liver involvement. Red tip = Heart Fire. Wiry = Liver constraint.
"Irritability, anger outbursts, frustration","Normal or slightly red body with RED SIDES, possible yellow coating if heat","WIRY pulse in left guan (Liver), may be rapid if transforming to heat",Liver Qi Stagnation transforming to Fire,Sides of tongue = Liver/Gallbladder. Red sides = Liver Fire. Wiry pulse = classic Liver Qi stagnation sign. Left guan = Liver position.
"Sighing, feeling of pressure in chest","Normal body, may have red sides, coating depends on other factors","WIRY pulse, especially left guan (Liver), may extend to other positions",Liver Qi Stagnation,Sighing = Liver Qi constraint trying to escape. Wiry = tense like guitar string. Liver constraint affects Qi flow throughout body.
Hypochondriac pain or distension,Red or purple sides of tongue,"Wiry, tight pulse in left guan (Liver/Gallbladder)",Liver Qi Stagnation,Sides of tongue directly correspond to Liver/GB channels. Pain in hypochondrium = Liver area. Tight pulse = pain/obstruction.
"Depression, feeling stuck, inability to move forward","Purple, dark, or lavender tongue body; or pale with purple sides","Wiry but weak pulse, or deep wiry pulse",Liver Qi Stagnation with Blood Stasis or Qi deficiency,Purple = blood stasis from prolonged stagnation. Deep = interior pattern. Wiry but weak = constraint with underlying deficiency.
"Menstrual irregularities, PMS worsening","Purple sides, possible purple spots, dark coating","Wiry pulse in left guan (Liver), may be choppy if blood stasis",Liver Qi Stagnation affecting Blood,Liver regulates menstruation. Stagnation from grief disrupts flow. Choppy pulse = blood stasis. Purple spots = blood stagnation.
"Poor appetite, no desire to eat","Pale tongue with thick white coating in CENTER, possibly swollen","Weak, soggy pulse in right guan (Spleen/Stomach)",Spleen Qi Deficiency,Center of tongue = Spleen/Stomach. Thick coating = digestive stagnation. Swollen = dampness. Right guan = Spleen position. Soggy = dampness.
"Bloating, abdominal distension after eating","Swollen tongue with teeth marks on SIDES/EDGES, thick coating in center","Weak and slightly wiry pulse in right guan (Spleen), may be slippery",Spleen Qi Deficiency with Liver invading Spleen,Teeth marks = Spleen Qi too weak to hold tongue shape. Wiry in Spleen position = Liver attacking Spleen. Slippery = dampness/food stagnation.
"Loose stools, diarrhea","Pale, swollen tongue with thick white coating, teeth marks on edges","Weak, soggy or slippery pulse in right guan (Spleen)",Spleen Qi Deficiency with Dampness,Spleen transforms and transports. Weakness causes dampness and loose stools. Soggy/slippery pulse = dampness. Thick coating = turbid dampness.
"Excessive worry, rumination, obsessive thoughts","Pale or slightly red tongue, may have thick coating in center",Weak pulse in right guan (Spleen) and left cun (Heart),Spleen-Heart Deficiency (overthinking depletes Spleen),Spleen houses Yi (thought/intention). Overthinking damages Spleen. Heart-Spleen both affected in grief with rumination. Both pulses weak.
"Mental fog, difficulty concentrating","Swollen pale tongue with greasy coating, possible teeth marks","Soggy, slippery pulse in right guan (Spleen)",Spleen Deficiency with Phlegm misting mind,Phlegm obscures clarity. Greasy coating = phlegm-dampness. Swollen tongue = Spleen cannot transform fluids. Slippery = phlegm.
"Deep fatigue, exhaustion, feeling depleted",Pale tongue with thin or NO coating at ROOT (back of tongue),"Deep, weak pulse in both chi positions (Kidneys), especially left chi (Kidney Yin)",Kidney Essence Deficiency from prolonged grief,Root/back of tongue = Kidneys. No coating at root = Kidney Yin severe deficiency. Chi positions = Kidneys. Deep weak = interior deficiency.
"Lower back pain, knee weakness","Pale root (back) of tongue, may be normal body otherwise","Weak, deep pulse in chi positions (Kidneys), left and/or right",Kidney Qi/Yang Deficiency,Kidneys govern lower back and knees. Root of tongue = Kidney area. Deep = interior. Weak in chi = Kidney deficiency.
"Tinnitus, hearing loss",Pale or red tongue root depending on Yin vs Yang deficiency,"Weak pulse in left chi (Kidney), may be thin if Yin deficient",Kidney Essence Deficiency,Kidneys open to ears. Essence deficiency from prolonged grief. Thin pulse = Yin/Blood/Essence deficiency. Left chi = Kidney Yin.
"Fear, feeling afraid, loss of willpower","Pale root of tongue, may be wet/moist, possible trembling","Deep, weak pulse in chi positions (Kidneys), may be slightly rapid if Heart involvement",Kidney Deficiency; Kidney-Heart disharmony,Kidneys house willpower and fear emotion. Prolonged grief depletes Kidneys. Fear replaces sadness. Rapid in Heart but weak in Kidney = disharmony.
"Night sweats, five-palm heat","Red tongue with little to NO coating, especially at ROOT","Thin, rapid pulse in left chi (Kidney Yin) and left cun (Heart)",Kidney-Yin Deficiency with Empty Heat,Night sweats = Yin deficiency cannot control Yang. No coating = severe Yin depletion. Thin rapid = Yin deficiency heat. Root = Kidney area.
"Chest oppression, feeling of heavy weight on chest","Swollen tongue with greasy coating, may have purple tinge",Wiry and slippery pulse (Qi stagnation with phlegm),Phlegm-Qi Binding (Mei He Qi),Greasy coating = phlegm. Wiry = stagnation. Slippery = phlegm-dampness. Purple = blood stasis from long-term constraint. Affects chest area.
Lump in throat sensation (globus),"Swollen tongue with thick coating at BASE/ROOT, teeth marks","Wiry and slippery pulse, may be soggy",Phlegm-Qi Binding (Plum-Pit Qi),Classic Mei He Qi pattern. Thick coating at root = lower throat involvement. Wiry = constraint. Slippery = phlegm. Cannot swallow or spit out.
Fixed stabbing chest pain,"PURPLE or DARK RED tongue with purple spots, sublingual veins distended","CHOPPY or wiry pulse, may be thin",Blood Stasis in chest (Xue Fu Yu Xue),"Purple tongue = blood stasis. Sublingual vein distension = classic blood stasis sign. Choppy pulse = rough, uneven, blood not flowing smoothly."
"Emotional numbness, inability to feel emotions","Pale, dull tongue, may be slightly purple, thin coating or no coating","Deep, thin, weak pulse in multiple positions",Severe Qi and Blood Deficiency; possible stagnation,Extreme depletion. Pale = deficiency. Purple tinge = stagnation. Deep = interior. Multiple positions weak = multi-organ involvement. Emotional shutdown.
"Bitter taste in mouth, dry throat","Red tongue with yellow coating, red sides (Liver area)","Wiry and rapid pulse in left guan (Liver), may be in other positions",Liver-Fire or Liver-Gallbladder Damp-Heat,Grief stagnation transforms to heat. Red sides = Liver Fire. Yellow coating = heat. Bitter taste = Gallbladder heat. Rapid = heat present.
"Difficulty expectorating phlegm, dry cough","Red tongue with scanty coating, dry, cracks possible","Thin, slightly rapid pulse in right cun (Lung)",Lung Yin Deficiency (dry grief consuming fluids),Prolonged grief damages Lung Yin. Dry tongue = fluid deficiency. Scanty coating = Yin damage. Thin rapid = Yin deficiency. Front area = Lung.
"Cold hands and feet, feeling cold","Pale, moist, swollen tongue","Deep, slow, weak pulse, especially in chi positions (Kidneys) and right cun (Lung)",Yang Deficiency (Lung-Kidney Yang Deficiency),"Prolonged grief depletes Yang. Pale, moist, swollen = cold and dampness. Slow pulse = cold. Deep weak = interior Yang deficiency. Chi = Kidney Yang."
