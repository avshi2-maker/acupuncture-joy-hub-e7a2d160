Question,Answer,TCM Acupuncture Points,Pharmacopeia/Herbal Formula
What organ system is primarily affected by grief in TCM?,"In Traditional Chinese Medicine, grief primarily affects the Lung organ system. The Lungs house the corporeal soul (Po) and are responsible for dispersing and descending Qi. Prolonged grief can deplete Lung Qi, leading to fatigue, shallow breathing, and weakened immune function.","LU-1 (Zhongfu), LU-3 (Tianfu), LU-7 (Lieque), LU-9 (Taiyuan)","Gan Mai Da Zao Tang (Licorice, Wheat, and Jujube Decoction) - nourishes Heart, calms Shen, harmonizes Liver-Heart disharmony"
How does grief manifest emotionally and physically according to TCM?,"Grief in TCM manifests as stagnant Lung Qi with symptoms including chest oppression, difficulty breathing, fatigue, weakened voice, pallor, and lowered immunity. Emotionally, it presents as sadness, withdrawal, inability to express feelings, muddled thinking, and depression. When grief is unresolved, it can affect the Heart, causing palpitations and insomnia.","LU-3 (Tianfu), PC-6 (Neiguan), PC-7 (Daling), HT-7 (Shenmen)","Banxia Houpo Tang (Pinellia and Magnolia Decoction) - promotes Qi circulation, dissolves phlegm, calms adverse Qi, treats globus sensation"
What is the relationship between the Lung and Heart in grief processing?,"The Lung and Heart share an intimate relationship in TCM, as both are located in the upper jiao (chest area). The Heart houses the Shen (Spirit/Mind) while the Lungs house the Po (Corporeal Soul). Grief depletes Lung Qi, which can fail to nourish Heart Qi, leading to Heart-Lung Qi deficiency with symptoms of palpitations, anxiety, heartbreak, and emotional fragility.","PC-7 (Daling), ST-36 (Zusanli), HT-7 (Shenmen), LU-7 (Lieque), CV-17 (Shanzhong)","Kaixinsan (Open Heart Powder) - invigorates vital energy, nourishes Heart, tranquilizes mind, treats Heart Qi deficiency and Heart-Kidney disharmony"
How does grief affect the body's defensive Qi (Wei Qi)?,"Grief depletes Lung Qi, which is responsible for producing and distributing Wei Qi (defensive Qi) throughout the body. When Wei Qi is weakened, immunity decreases, making individuals more susceptible to external pathogens, frequent colds, and respiratory infections. This explains why grieving individuals often experience increased illness.","LU-7 (Lieque), ST-36 (Zusanli), LI-4 (Hegu), BL-13 (Feishu), CV-6 (Qihai)","Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Tonify the Middle and Augment the Qi Decoction) - tonifies Lung and Spleen Qi, raises Yang, strengthens Wei Qi"
What is the connection between grief and the Liver in TCM?,"When grief persists, it can lead to Liver Qi stagnation, as unexpressed emotions accumulate. The Liver is responsible for the smooth flow of Qi and emotions. Liver Qi stagnation from grief manifests as irritability, frustration, chest tightness, sighing, depression, and may create a pattern called 'Liver Insults the Lung' where stagnant Liver Qi attacks the already weakened Lungs.","LR-3 (Taichong), LR-14 (Qimen), LU-1 (Zhongfu), GB-34 (Yanglingquan), PC-6 (Neiguan)","Chai Hu Shu Gan San (Bupleurum Powder to Spread the Liver) - soothes Liver, regulates Qi, promotes blood circulation, relieves Liver Qi stagnation"
How does TCM view the difference between acute grief and chronic unresolved grief?,"Acute grief is seen as a natural Lung Qi response that temporarily weakens the body but can resolve with time and support. Chronic unresolved grief leads to deeper imbalances: Lung Qi deficiency, Heart-Lung Qi deficiency, Liver Qi stagnation, or phlegm-Qi binding. Chronic grief can transform into depression (Yu Zheng), create internal heat, or deplete Kidney Yin and Yang over time.","LU-3 (Tianfu), LU-9 (Taiyuan), PC-7 (Daling), KI-3 (Taixi), SP-6 (Sanyinjiao)","Xiao Yao San (Free and Easy Wanderer) - soothes Liver, strengthens Spleen, nourishes blood, regulates menstruation, treats Liver Qi stagnation with blood deficiency"
What is the role of phlegm in grief-related depression in TCM?,"In TCM, prolonged grief can lead to phlegm formation when Lung Qi stagnation impairs fluid metabolism and Spleen function. This creates a pattern called 'phlegm-Qi stagnation and binding' (Mei He Qi or plum-pit Qi), characterized by a sensation of obstruction in the throat, chest oppression, difficulty expressing emotions, and mental fog. Phlegm misting the Heart can cause severe depression and cognitive dysfunction.","ST-40 (Fenglong), PC-5 (Jianshi), CV-12 (Zhongwan), CV-17 (Shanzhong), SP-9 (Yinlingquan)","Banxia Houpo Tang (Pinellia and Magnolia Decoction) - eliminates phlegm, promotes Qi circulation, opens chest, treats globus hystericus and phlegm-Qi binding"
How does acupuncture help process grief according to recent research?,"Recent studies (2022) show acupuncture reduces hyperarousal, induces relaxation, and reduces inflammation in emotional trauma. It balances sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, reduces limbic system activation for calming effects, and reshapes functional connectivity in the default-mode network. Acupuncture enhances parasympathetic tone and decreases sympathetic activity, helping process traumatic memories and grief through neural modulation.","PC-6 (Neiguan), HT-7 (Shenmen), GV-20 (Baihui), GV-24 (Shenting), Yintang (EX-HN3)","Gan Mai Da Zao Tang - reduces glutamate levels, increases NMDA receptor subunits (NR2A, NR2B) in frontal cortex and hippocampus, improves brain monoamine neurotransmitters (NE, 5-HT)"
What specific acupuncture points help with expressing grief and emotional release?,"LU-3 (Tianfu - Heavenly Palace) is particularly beneficial for helping individuals talk and express feelings about loss. It addresses forgetfulness, muddled thinking, and depression related to grief. Combined with LU-1 (Zhongfu - Middle Palace) and CV-17 (Shanzhong - Chest Center), these points open the chest, release stagnant emotions, and facilitate healthy grieving expression.","LU-3 (Tianfu), LU-1 (Zhongfu), CV-17 (Shanzhong), PC-6 (Neiguan), LU-7 (Lieque)","Yue Ju Wan (Gardenia and Ligusticum Formula) - regulates Qi flow, relieves depression, removes six stagnancies (Qi, dampness, fire, phlegm, blood, food)"
How does grief affect sleep and the Heart-Spirit (Shen) in TCM?,"Grief disturbs the Shen (Spirit) housed in the Heart, leading to insomnia, vivid dreams, restless sleep, and nocturnal anxiety. When Lung Qi deficiency affects Heart Qi, it creates Heart-Lung Qi deficiency or Heart-Yin deficiency, manifesting as difficulty falling asleep, waking easily, palpitations, night sweats, and emotional instability. The unsettled Shen cannot root properly.","HT-7 (Shenmen), PC-7 (Daling), PC-6 (Neiguan), Yintang (EX-HN3), Anmian (EX-HN22), SP-6 (Sanyinjiao)","Gan Mai Da Zao Tang (Licorice, Wheat, and Jujube Decoction) - nourishes Heart Yin, tranquilizes Shen, regulates middle jiao, relieves emotional spasms and restlessness"
What is the significance of LU-7 (Lieque) in treating grief?,"LU-7 (Lieque - Broken Sequence) is the Luo-connecting point of the Lung meridian and master point of the Conception Vessel. It is crucial for boosting Wei Qi (defensive Qi), addressing fatigue and low energy from grief. It opens the chest, releases exterior conditions, and helps restore the Lung's ability to disperse and descend Qi. It's particularly effective for grief-related immune weakness and respiratory vulnerability.","LU-7 (Lieque), LI-4 (Hegu), BL-13 (Feishu), ST-36 (Zusanli), CV-17 (Shanzhong)","Yu Ping Feng San (Jade Windscreen Powder) - tonifies Lung Qi, consolidates exterior, stabilizes Wei Qi, prevents recurrent infections in grief-weakened immunity"
How does the Spleen become involved in chronic grief patterns?,"Chronic grief often leads to Liver Qi stagnation, which can invade the Spleen (Liver-Spleen disharmony), causing digestive issues, poor appetite, fatigue, worry, and overthinking. The Spleen is also weakened when grief depletes Lung Qi, as the Lung-Spleen relationship is vital for Qi production. This creates a vicious cycle of emotional and physical depletion with symptoms of fatigue, loose stools, and poor concentration.","SP-6 (Sanyinjiao), ST-36 (Zusanli), SP-3 (Taibai), LR-3 (Taichong), CV-12 (Zhongwan)","Xiao Yao San (Free and Easy Wanderer) or Si Ni San (Frigid Extremities Powder) - soothes Liver, strengthens Spleen, harmonizes Liver-Spleen, treats digestive symptoms from emotional stress"
What is PC-7 (Daling) and why is it powerful for broken hearts?,"PC-7 (Daling - Great Mound) is the Shu-stream and Yuan-source point of the Pericardium meridian. It is renowned for healing emotional heartbreak and grief. The Pericardium protects the Heart and houses the Shen. PC-7 calms the spirit, clears Heart fire from emotional pain, treats anxiety, palpitations, insomnia, and emotional trauma. It's especially effective for the heartache aspect of grief and post-traumatic stress.","PC-7 (Daling), PC-6 (Neiguan), HT-7 (Shenmen), CV-17 (Shanzhong), PC-8 (Laogong)","Suan Zao Ren Tang (Sour Jujube Decoction) - nourishes Heart and Liver blood, calms Shen, treats insomnia and anxiety from blood deficiency and emotional distress"
How do Back Shu points support grief treatment?,"Back Shu points directly influence their associated organs and are powerful for treating grief. BL-13 (Feishu - Lung Shu) tonifies Lung Qi, BL-15 (Xinshu - Heart Shu) calms the Shen and nourishes Heart, BL-18 (Ganshu - Liver Shu) soothes Liver Qi stagnation, and BL-20 (Pishu - Spleen Shu) strengthens digestive function. These points treat the root organ imbalances caused by grief.","BL-13 (Feishu), BL-15 (Xinshu), BL-18 (Ganshu), BL-20 (Pishu), BL-23 (Shenshu)","Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Tonify Middle and Augment Qi) - strengthens Spleen and Lung Qi, raises Yang, treats organ deficiencies underlying grief patterns"
What role does CV-17 (Shanzhong) play in emotional release?,"CV-17 (Shanzhong - Chest Center) is the Influential Point of Qi and the Alarm Point of the Pericardium. Located at the heart chakra level, it's crucial for releasing stagnant emotions trapped in the chest. It regulates Qi flow, opens the chest, treats chest oppression, grief, anxiety, and the physical sensation of heartache. It facilitates deep emotional release and is often combined with lung points for grief.","CV-17 (Shanzhong), PC-6 (Neiguan), LU-1 (Zhongfu), CV-15 (Jiuwei), CV-14 (Juque)","Zhi Zi Chi Tang (Gardenia and Fermented Soybean Decoction) - clears constraint and heat from the chest, releases pent-up frustration and irritability from stagnant emotions"
How does acupuncture address the neurobiology of grief based on recent studies?,"Recent research (2022) demonstrates acupuncture modulates the default-mode network (DMN), which is involved in autobiographical memory and pain processing. Acupuncture increases functional connectivity between the DMN and hippocampus, enhancing memory processing and emotional regulation. It reduces glutamate levels, increases NMDA receptor subunits in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and improves monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) in grief and depression.","GV-20 (Baihui), GV-24 (Shenting), PC-6 (Neiguan), ST-36 (Zusanli), KI-3 (Taixi)","Gan Mai Da Zao Tang - modulates glutamate-NMDA receptor systems, increases 5-HT and NE levels in hippocampus, reduces oxidative stress markers (MDA), improves neuroplasticity"
What is the Six Stagnancy pattern and how does it relate to complicated grief?,"The Six Stagnancy pattern includes stagnation of Qi, Blood, Phlegm, Fire, Food, and Dampness. Complicated grief can manifest as this pattern when multiple systems become blocked. Qi stagnation from unexpressed emotions leads to blood stasis, phlegm accumulation, internal heat, digestive stagnation, and dampness. This creates complex symptoms including chest pain, digestive issues, mental fog, irritability, and physical pain.","CV-12 (Zhongwan), ST-40 (Fenglong), SP-6 (Sanyinjiao), LR-3 (Taichong), SP-10 (Xuehai)","Yue Ju Wan (Gardenia and Ligusticum Formula) - specifically treats six stagnancies, regulates Qi, removes food stagnation, resolves phlegm, invigorates blood, clears heat"
How should grief be treated differently in different constitutional types?,"Yin-deficient types with grief need nourishing herbs (Gan Mai Da Zao Tang, Suan Zao Ren Tang) and gentle points (KI-3, SP-6, LU-9). Yang-deficient types need warming tonics (Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang) with moxa on ST-36, CV-6. Qi-stagnant types need stronger moving herbs (Chai Hu Shu Gan San, Yue Ju Wan) and reducing manipulation at LR-3, GB-34. Phlegm types need transforming herbs (Banxia Houpo Tang) with ST-40, SP-9.","Constitutional assessment determines point selection: Yin deficiency (KI-3, SP-6, LU-9), Yang deficiency (ST-36, CV-6, GV-4), Qi stagnation (LR-3, GB-34, LI-4), Phlegm (ST-40, SP-9, CV-12)","Formula selection by constitution: Yin deficiency - Gan Mai Da Zao Tang, Suan Zao Ren Tang; Yang deficiency - Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang; Qi stagnation - Chai Hu Shu Gan San, Xiao Yao San; Phlegm - Banxia Houpo Tang"
What is the treatment principle for acute grief in the first weeks of loss?,"Initial treatment focuses on supporting Lung Qi, calming the Shen, and preventing stagnation. Use gentle tonifying methods with points like LU-9, PC-7, HT-7, ST-36 to nourish and stabilize. Herbal formulas should tonify Qi and calm the spirit (Gan Mai Da Zao Tang, Kaixinsan). Avoid strong reducing methods initially. Create space for natural grieving while preventing collapse into pathological patterns. Support sleep and basic energy.","LU-9 (Taiyuan), PC-7 (Daling), HT-7 (Shenmen), ST-36 (Zusanli), Yintang (EX-HN3), KI-3 (Taixi)","Gan Mai Da Zao Tang (Licorice, Wheat, Jujube) or Kaixinsan (Open Heart Powder) - gentle formulas that nourish Heart and Lung, calm Shen, support natural grieving without suppressing emotions"
When should stronger moving and breaking techniques be used for stagnant grief?,"After 3-6 months, if grief becomes stuck with significant Qi and blood stagnation, liver constraint, or phlegm binding, stronger techniques are appropriate. Use reducing manipulation at LR-3, LI-4, SP-10 to move stagnation. Employ formulas that strongly move Qi and blood (Chai Hu Shu Gan San, Yue Ju Wan). Treat chest oppression, irritability, fixed pain, purple tongue, wiry pulse. Goal is to break through emotional blockages preventing healing.","LR-3 (Taichong), LI-4 (Hegu), SP-10 (Xuehai), GB-34 (Yanglingquan), LR-14 (Qimen), SP-4 (Gongsun)","Chai Hu Shu Gan San, Yue Ju Wan, or Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang (Blood Mansion Stasis-Expelling Decoction) - stronger formulas that move Qi, invigorate blood, break stagnation, clear constraint"
How does grief affect the Kidney system in prolonged cases?,"Prolonged grief can deplete Kidney essence and create Kidney-Heart disharmony. The Kidneys store ancestral Qi and essence, which become depleted when grief chronically drains the body. Symptoms include deep fatigue, back pain, knee weakness, tinnitus, memory problems, premature aging, fear, and loss of willpower. The fear response replaces grief, creating a water-fire imbalance between Kidneys (water) and Heart (fire).","KI-3 (Taixi), KI-7 (Fuliu), BL-23 (Shenshu), CV-4 (Guanyuan), GV-4 (Mingmen), KI-1 (Yongquan)",Kaixinsan (Open Heart Powder) treats Heart-Kidney disharmony; Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill) nourishes Kidney Yin; Jin Kui Shen Qi Wan tonifies Kidney Yang in prolonged grief depletion
What is the clinical evidence for GV-20 (Baihui) in treating grief and PTSD?,"GV-20 (Baihui) is the most evidence-supported acupuncture point for emotional trauma, appearing in 78.6% of PTSD studies according to a 2023 meta-analysis. It was used in 12 of 19 clinical studies and 32 of 37 animal studies. Research shows GV-20 regulates autonomic nerves via cerebral cortex reflexes, increases excitability of relevant brain areas, and modulates neuroinflammation-related cognitive dysfunction, depression, and anxiety associated with grief and trauma.","GV-20 (Baihui), GV-24 (Shenting), EX-HN1 (Sishencong), GV-29 (Yintang), PC-6 (Neiguan)","Formulas supporting brain regulation: An Shen Bu Xin Wan (Calm Spirit, Tonify Heart) - nourishes Heart blood, calms Shen, treats anxiety and insomnia with cognitive symptoms"
What does clinical research reveal about PC-6 (Neiguan) for stress and grief?,"PC-6 (Neiguan) has robust experimental evidence from multiple controlled studies. A 2017 study demonstrated that acupuncture at PC-6 significantly attenuated stress-induced anxiety by suppressing amygdaloid norepinephrine synthesis and normalizing stress hormones (corticosterone). Research published in Nature (2022) found PC-6 affects functional connectivity of the amygdala and default-mode network following verum but not sham acupuncture, producing mechanism-specific anxiolytic effects for emotional trauma and grief.","PC-6 (Neiguan), PC-7 (Daling), HT-7 (Shenmen), CV-17 (Shanzhong), PC-5 (Jianshi)","Suan Zao Ren Tang (Sour Jujube Decoction) - reduces amygdala hyperactivity, nourishes Heart blood, calms Shen, treats stress-induced insomnia and palpitations"
What are the outcomes from randomized controlled trials on acupuncture for PTSD and grief?,"A 2024 RCT published in JAMA Psychiatry with 93 combat veterans showed verum acupuncture produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms versus sham needling, with moderate effect size (Cohen d=0.63). A 2014 RCT with 55 service members found acupuncture reduced PTSD symptoms by 19.8 points on PCL versus 9.7 for usual care (p<0.001), also improving depression, pain, and physical/mental health with large effect sizes. No serious adverse events were reported.","Points used in trials: GV-20 (Baihui), PC-6 (Neiguan), HT-7 (Shenmen), GV-24 (Shenting), GB-20 (Fengchi), ST-36 (Zusanli)","Evidence-based formula support: Chai Hu Jia Long Gu Mu Li Tang (Bupleurum plus Dragon Bone and Oyster Shell) - treats anxiety, emotional instability, palpitations, insomnia from trauma"
How does HT-7 (Shenmen) compare to PC-6 in clinical studies for emotional trauma?,"HT-7 (Shenmen) is among the top four most-used points in animal studies for PTSD. Research shows both PC-6 and HT-7 produce mechanism-specific anxiolytic effects, but their efficacy depends on the type of trauma. While PC-6 primarily affects amygdaloid norepinephrine and stress hormone regulation, HT-7 as the Heart meridian's Shu-Stream and Yuan-Source point directly calms the Shen (Spirit) housed in the Heart. Both points are critical in evidence-based protocols for treating anxiety disorders related to grief and trauma.","HT-7 (Shenmen), PC-6 (Neiguan), PC-7 (Daling), HT-5 (Tongli), HT-8 (Shaofu)","Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan (Emperor of Heaven's Special Pill) - enriches Yin, nourishes blood, tonifies Heart, calms Shen, treats Heart-Kidney disharmony with severe anxiety"
What are the top evidence-supported point combinations for grief treatment protocols?,"Based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the most evidence-supported combination includes: GV-20 (Baihui) for neurological regulation appearing in 78.6% of studies, PC-6 (Neiguan) for amygdala modulation, HT-7 (Shenmen) for calming Shen, GV-24 (Shenting) for cognitive symptoms, and ST-36 (Zusanli) for supporting overall Qi and immune function. Additional frequently-used points include GB-20 (Fengchi) and EX-HN1 (Sishencong). This combination addresses multiple neurobiological pathways: autonomic balance, limbic system regulation, and default-mode network connectivity.","Primary protocol: GV-20 (Baihui), PC-6 (Neiguan), HT-7 (Shenmen), GV-24 (Shenting), ST-36 (Zusanli), GB-20 (Fengchi), EX-HN1 (Sishencong)","Protocol support formula: Gui Pi Tang (Restore the Spleen Decoction) - tonifies Heart and Spleen, nourishes blood, calms Shen, treats anxiety and insomnia from deficiency patterns underlying chronic grief"
What neurobiological mechanisms explain acupuncture's effectiveness for grief?,"Research demonstrates acupuncture produces anxiolytic effects through three neurobiological levels: (1) balancing sympathetic-parasympathetic autonomic activity, reducing hyperarousal; (2) reducing limbic system activation, especially amygdala deactivation, which processes fear and emotional memories; (3) reshaping functional connectivity within the default-mode network involved in autobiographical memory and self-referential processing. Studies show acupuncture modulates neurotransmitters including reducing glutamate levels, increasing NMDA receptor subunits (NR2A, NR2B) in frontal cortex and hippocampus, and improving monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine).","Neuromodulatory points: GV-20 (Baihui), PC-6 (Neiguan), GV-24 (Shenting), Yintang (EX-HN3), KI-3 (Taixi), ST-36 (Zusanli)","Gan Mai Da Zao Tang - modulates glutamate-NMDA systems, increases 5-HT and NE in hippocampus; Chai Hu Shu Gan San - regulates HPA axis, reduces cortisol, improves neurotransmitter balance in stress response"
What does meta-analysis data show about acupuncture versus conventional treatments for trauma?,"A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis found acupuncture significantly improved validated symptom scores compared to pharmacotherapy on multiple measures: CAPS (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale), HAMA (Hamilton Anxiety), HAMD (Hamilton Depression), PCL-C (PTSD Checklist), and SCL-90 somatization subscale. Acupuncture also outperformed psychotherapy on CAPS, PCL-C, and HAMD scores. Importantly, no serious adverse events were reported across studies, demonstrating a superior safety profile compared to pharmaceutical interventions for grief and trauma-related symptoms.","Evidence-based point selection from meta-analysis: GV-20 (Baihui), PC-6 (Neiguan), HT-7 (Shenmen), ST-36 (Zusanli), GV-24 (Shenting), GB-20 (Fengchi)","Safe herbal alternatives to pharmaceuticals: Xiao Yao San (Free and Easy Wanderer) - excellent safety profile, treats depression and anxiety from Liver Qi stagnation; Bai He Di Huang Tang - nourishes Yin, clears heat, treats emotional instability"
What are the classic tongue signs of Lung Qi Deficiency from grief?,"In grief-related Lung Qi Deficiency, the tongue typically shows pale coloring (often in the front third where the Lung area is located), a slightly sunken or swollen shape indicating weakness, thin or scanty coating reflecting Qi depletion, and a dry surface. The pale tongue indicates insufficient Qi and Yang to bring blood and warmth to the tongue. The front third location corresponds to the Upper Jiao where the Lungs reside.","LU-9 (Taiyuan), LU-7 (Lieque), BL-13 (Feishu), ST-36 (Zusanli), CV-17 (Shanzhong)","Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Tonify Middle and Augment Qi) - tonifies Lung and Spleen Qi, raises Yang, treats pale tongue from Qi deficiency"
How does the pulse present in acute grief with Lung Qi depletion?,"Acute grief typically presents with a weak, empty, or thin pulse, particularly in the right cun (inch) position which corresponds to the Lung. The pulse may feel floating and weak, indicating Lung Qi unable to anchor. It lacks strength and substance when pressed. In some cases, the pulse may be slightly rapid if accompanied by anxiety or Heart involvement, but the overall quality remains weak and deficient rather than full or forceful.","LU-9 (Taiyuan) tonifies Lung Qi directly, PC-7 (Daling), HT-7 (Shenmen), ST-36 (Zusanli), KI-3 (Taixi)","Sheng Mai San (Generate the Pulse Powder) - tonifies Lung Qi, generates fluids, preserves Yin, treats weak deficient pulse from grief exhaustion"
What symptoms distinguish Liver Qi Stagnation from Lung Qi Deficiency in grief?,"Lung Qi Deficiency presents with weakness, fatigue, pale complexion, weak voice, shallow breathing, vulnerability to colds, and passive sadness. Liver Qi Stagnation manifests with irritability, sighing, chest tightness, hypochondriac distension, mood swings, frustration, and a wiry pulse. Many grief cases present as mixed patterns: initial Lung Qi weakness progressing to Liver stagnation when emotions become stuck, creating the 'Metal Fails to Control Wood' pattern with both exhaustion and irritability.","Lung deficiency: LU-9, LU-7, ST-36; Liver stagnation: LR-3, GB-34, PC-6; Combined: LR-3, LU-7, PC-6, CV-17",Lung deficiency: Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang; Liver stagnation: Chai Hu Shu Gan San; Combined pattern: Xiao Yao San harmonizes both systems
What tongue and pulse signs indicate phlegm-Qi binding (Mei He Qi) from grief?,"Phlegm-Qi binding presents with a swollen tongue body with tooth marks on the edges (indicating Spleen Qi deficiency and dampness), thick sticky or greasy coating (white or yellow depending on heat presence), and possible red tip if accompanied by Heart fire. The pulse is typically wiry (from Qi stagnation) and slippery or soggy (from phlegm-dampness). Patients describe a 'lump in the throat' sensation that can neither be swallowed nor coughed up, with chest oppression.","ST-40 (Fenglong), PC-5 (Jianshi), CV-12 (Zhongwan), CV-17 (Shanzhong), CV-22 (Tiantu), SP-9 (Yinlingquan)","Banxia Houpo Tang (Pinellia and Magnolia Decoction) - transforms phlegm, moves Qi, opens chest, treats plum-pit Qi and globus sensation"
How do you differentiate Heart-Lung Qi Deficiency from Heart-Yin Deficiency in grief?,"Heart-Lung Qi Deficiency shows pale tongue, thin white coating, weak empty pulse (especially right cun and left cun positions), cold extremities, daytime fatigue, spontaneous sweating, and dull emotional numbness. Heart-Yin Deficiency presents with red tongue (especially tip), little or no coating, thin rapid pulse, night sweats, five-palm heat, restlessness at night, vivid dreams, anxiety, and more agitated sadness. Qi deficiency is colder and more depleted; Yin deficiency is warmer with internal heat signs.","Qi deficiency: HT-7, PC-6, LU-9, ST-36, CV-17; Yin deficiency: HT-7, HT-6, KI-3, SP-6, PC-7, KI-6","Qi deficiency: Gui Pi Tang (Restore Spleen) tonifies Qi and blood; Yin deficiency: Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan (Emperor's Heart Pill) nourishes Yin, clears heat, calms Shen"
What are the physical symptoms of Wei Qi deficiency in grieving patients?,"Wei Qi (Defensive Qi) deficiency from grief-depleted Lung Qi manifests as frequent colds and flu (catching every pathogen), prolonged recovery from illness, spontaneous daytime sweating (especially upper body and face), aversion to wind and cold, weak immune response, new environmental allergies, chronic rhinitis, and general susceptibility to external pathogens. The body's protective barrier becomes porous, unable to defend against invasions. This often appears 2-6 weeks after acute grief begins.","LU-7 (Lieque), LI-4 (Hegu), ST-36 (Zusanli), BL-13 (Feishu), CV-6 (Qihai), GV-14 (Dazhui)","Yu Ping Feng San (Jade Windscreen Powder) - tonifies Lung Qi, consolidates exterior, stabilizes Wei Qi, prevents recurrent infections and spontaneous sweating"
What symptoms indicate the 'Metal Fails to Control Wood' pattern in chronic grief?,"This pattern occurs when depleted Lung Qi (Metal) can no longer control Liver Qi (Wood), creating simultaneous weakness and constraint. Symptoms include: fatigue with irritability, sadness with sudden anger outbursts, pale face with red eyes, weak breathing with sighing, chest oppression with hypochondriac pain, vulnerability to colds with menstrual irregularities, and depression alternating with frustration. The pulse is weak overall but wiry in the Liver position. The tongue is pale with slightly red or purple sides.","LU-7 (Lieque), LR-3 (Taichong), PC-6 (Neiguan), LU-1 (Zhongfu), GB-34 (Yanglingquan), ST-36 (Zusanli)","Xiao Yao San (Free and Easy Wanderer) - simultaneously tonifies Spleen/Lung and soothes Liver, harmonizes Wood-Metal relationship, treats mixed deficiency-excess"
How does grief manifest with Spleen involvement and what are the diagnostic signs?,"When grief affects the Spleen (via Liver invading Spleen or Lung-Spleen connection), symptoms include poor appetite, bloating after eating, loose stools, excessive worry and rumination ('can't shut my mind off'), fatigue, poor concentration, obsessive thoughts about loss, and digestive disturbance. The tongue is pale with thick coating and teeth marks on edges. The pulse is weak in the right guan (middle) position and possibly soggy. This creates the triad: sadness + rumination + digestive weakness.","SP-6 (Sanyinjiao), ST-36 (Zusanli), SP-3 (Taibai), CV-12 (Zhongwan), PC-6 (Neiguan), LU-9 (Taiyuan)","Gui Pi Tang (Restore the Spleen Decoction) - tonifies Spleen and Heart Qi, nourishes blood, calms Shen, treats rumination and insomnia from Spleen-Heart deficiency"
What are the diagnostic criteria for Liver Qi Invading Lung pattern in grief?,"This pattern shows Liver constraint attacking weakened Lungs: chest oppression and distension, difficulty taking deep breaths, sighing, hypochondriac pain radiating to chest, cough with no phlegm or difficulty expectorating, emotional outbursts alternating with withdrawal, irritability with sadness, and symptoms worse with stress or emotional triggers. Tongue: normal or slightly red with red sides. Pulse: wiry (Liver) and slightly weak or tight in Lung position. This pattern indicates stuck grief transforming into frustration.","LR-3 (Taichong), LR-14 (Qimen), LU-1 (Zhongfu), CV-17 (Shanzhong), PC-6 (Neiguan), GB-34 (Yanglingquan)","Chai Hu Shu Gan San (Bupleurum Spread Liver) or Xiao Yao San - soothes Liver Qi, protects Lung, regulates Qi flow between organs, treats constraint attacking deficiency"
What tongue presentation indicates Heart-Fire from unresolved grief?,"When grief stagnation transforms to heat, Heart-Fire develops: tongue tip becomes very red or has red points, thin yellow coating may appear, possible ulcers or sores on tongue tip, cracks in the Heart area (center-tip), and overall body may be normal or slightly red. Symptoms include agitation, insomnia with racing thoughts, palpitations, anxiety, bitter taste, thirst, and emotional volatility. The stagnant grief has transformed from cold/deficient pattern to hot/excess pattern requiring different treatment approach.","HT-8 (Shaofu), HT-7 (Shenmen), PC-7 (Daling), CV-15 (Jiuwei), SP-6 (Sanyinjiao), KI-3 (Taixi)","Huang Lian E Jiao Tang (Coptis and Ass-Hide Gelatin Decoction) - clears Heart Fire, nourishes Yin, calms Shen, treats insomnia and agitation from Fire harassing Heart"
How do you diagnose Kidney-Heart disharmony in prolonged grief?,"This pattern develops after months/years of grief depleting both systems: palpitations with lower back weakness, insomnia with nocturnal urination, anxiety with deep fatigue, restless agitation with fear, poor memory with tinnitus, night sweats with cold feet, and feeling emotionally fragile with physical exhaustion. Tongue: red tip (Heart Fire) with pale or purple root (Kidney deficiency). Pulse: weak in both cun (Heart) and chi (Kidney) positions, possibly rapid but weak.

What pulse qualities distinguish excess versus deficiency patterns in grief?,"Deficiency patterns (early grief, Lung/Heart Qi deficiency) show weak, thin, empty pulses lacking force when pressed deeply, possibly floating but without strength. Excess patterns (Liver Qi stagnation, phlegm-Qi binding, blood stasis) show wiry, tight, or choppy pulses with resistance and force. Mixed patterns combine qualities: wiry but weak (deficiency with constraint), or slippery and wiry (phlegm with Qi stagnation).
