Aspect,Details,Rationale/Notes
LOCATION - General,HT-7 (Shenmen 神门 Spirit Gate),Yuan-Source point and Shu-Stream point of Heart meridian
LOCATION - Anatomical,"Ulnar end of transverse wrist crease, in depression on radial side of flexor carpi ulnaris tendon",Between pisiform bone and ulnar bone
LOCATION - How to find,Ask patient to make fist; tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris will stand out. Point is in depression radial (thumb-side) to this tendon at wrist crease.,Clear landmark - easy to palpate
LOCATION - Depth of point,Superficial location - between skin and tendon/bone,Shallow needling required
NEEDLE SIZE - Length,25mm (1 cun) standard,Sufficient length for 0.3-0.5 cun insertion
NEEDLE SIZE - Gauge,0.25mm diameter (standard gauge) or 0.20mm (thin),Thin gauge appropriate for wrist point
NEEDLE SIZE - Type,"Stainless steel, disposable",Standard single-use acupuncture needle
DEPTH - Standard,0.3-0.5 cun perpendicular,Evidence-based depth from RCT protocols (Wu et al. 2020)
DEPTH - Shallow option,0.2-0.3 cun for sensitive patients,"Elderly, children, or very deficient patients"
DEPTH - Maximum,Never exceed 0.5 cun,Risk of ulnar nerve and ulnar artery damage if too deep
DEPTH - Sensation,Should feel slight resistance then ease as needle enters depression,Indicates proper depth between tendons
ANGLE - Standard,Perpendicular (90°) to skin surface,Most common method
ANGLE - Alternative,Oblique 10° toward elbow (following meridian),Traditional tonification approach - needle with Qi flow
ANGLE - To avoid,Never angle toward palm or deeply ulnar,Protects nerves and vessels
INSERTION - Preparation,"Clean area with alcohol swab, identify exact point with palpation",Ensure accurate location
INSERTION - Skin contact,"Touch skin with needle tip, guide tube or directly depending on preference",Establish contact before insertion
INSERTION - Entry,Quick tap through skin using guide tube OR slow penetration without tube,Both methods acceptable - practitioner preference
INSERTION - Speed,SLOW insertion after skin penetration,Reduces pain and allows tissue accommodation
INSERTION - Patient breathing,Insert as patient BREATHES OUT (for tonification),"Exhale = Yin phase, receptive to tonification"
INSERTION - Depth progression,"Advance slowly to 0.3 cun, pause, check for De Qi",Can stop at 0.3 if De Qi achieved
DE QI - Definition,"Arrival of Qi - compositional feeling of soreness, numbness, distension, heaviness",Essential for therapeutic effect
DE QI - Patient experience,"Dull ache, heaviness, warmth, tingling, or electrical sensation",Should NOT be sharp pain
DE QI - Practitioner experience,Feeling of 'grasp' or 'fish taking bait' - needle feels held by tissue,Tactile feedback of Qi arrival
DE QI - Propagation,Sensation may travel up arm along Heart meridian toward chest/heart,Indicates strong channel connection
DE QI - Intensity for insomnia,MILD to moderate - gentle De Qi sufficient,Strong stimulation can be counterproductive for sleep
DE QI - If not achieved,"Rotate needle gently, lift-thrust slightly, or redirect angle slightly",Adjust technique to obtain Qi
TONIFICATION - When to use,"Qi/Blood/Yin deficiency, pale tongue, weak pulse, fatigue, most chronic grief insomnia",95% of grief-related insomnia cases
TONIFICATION - Thrust-lift technique,"SLOW thrust (downward), FAST lift (upward)",Tonification rhythm
TONIFICATION - Rotation direction,Clockwise rotation (180° turn),Reinforcing method
TONIFICATION - Rotation speed,"Slow, gentle rotation",Avoid aggressive manipulation
TONIFICATION - Number of manipulations,2-3 gentle rotations or lift-thrust cycles,Minimal manipulation for insomnia
TONIFICATION - Patient breathing,Manipulate as patient INHALES,"Inhale = Yang phase, tonifying"
TONIFICATION - Needle angle during manipulation,Angle needle slightly AGAINST Qi flow (toward hand) during thrust,Traditional tonification technique
TONIFICATION - Practitioner intention,"Visualize bringing Qi TO the point, nourishing and calming",Mind-intention (Yi) important in Chinese medicine
EVEN METHOD - When to use,"Mixed patterns, first treatment, uncertain diagnosis",Safe neutral approach
EVEN METHOD - Technique,"Balanced thrust and lift (same speed), or simply obtain De Qi without manipulation",No reinforcing or reducing
EVEN METHOD - Rotation,Bidirectional rotation (alternate clockwise and counter-clockwise) or no rotation,Neutral stimulation
SEDATION - When to use,"Excess heat, Liver Fire, agitation with strength (rare in grief)",<5% of grief cases
SEDATION - Thrust-lift technique,"FAST thrust (downward), SLOW lift (upward)",Opposite of tonification
SEDATION - Rotation direction,Counter-clockwise rotation,Reducing method
SEDATION - Patient breathing,Manipulate as patient EXHALES,"Exhale = Yin phase, sedating"
SEDATION - Caution,Can further weaken already deficient patients,Assess carefully before using
RETENTION - Duration,20-30 minutes standard,Research protocols use 30 minutes
RETENTION - Patient position,Supine (lying down) preferred for insomnia treatment,Promotes relaxation
RETENTION - Environment,"Quiet, dimmed lights, comfortable temperature",Therapeutic atmosphere
RETENTION - Re-stimulation,Can gently rotate needle once at 10-15 minute mark if effect weakening,Optional - not always necessary
RETENTION - Patient instruction,"Rest quietly, close eyes, breathe naturally",Allow treatment to work
RETENTION - Monitoring,Check on patient periodically - ensure comfort and safety,Professional responsibility
REMOVAL - Timing,After 20-30 minutes retention,Full treatment duration
REMOVAL - Technique,"Rotate counter-clockwise slightly, then withdraw smoothly in one motion",Exit same pathway as entry
REMOVAL - Speed,Relatively quick but controlled withdrawal,Minimize tissue trauma
REMOVAL - Patient breathing,Remove as patient EXHALES (for tonification),Complete the tonification cycle
REMOVAL - Immediate action,Press point with dry cotton ball for 3-5 seconds,Prevent bleeding and close the hole
REMOVAL - Check for bleeding,Light pressure - minimal to no bleeding expected,HT-7 is relatively safe point
DURING TREATMENT - Normal sensations,"Heaviness in arm, warmth, tingling, dull ache, drowsiness, relaxation",Therapeutic responses
DURING TREATMENT - Desired effect,"Patient feels calm, may become drowsy, breathing deepens",Indicates effective treatment
DURING TREATMENT - Abnormal sensations,"Sharp pain, shooting pain, numbness in entire hand",Stop treatment if these occur
DURING TREATMENT - If numbness occurs,Slightly withdraw needle 1-2mm and redirect if hitting nerve,Safety adjustment
SAFETY - Anatomy to avoid,"Ulnar nerve (passes near point), ulnar artery (radial to nerve)",Major structures nearby
SAFETY - Depth limit,Maximum 0.5 cun - deeper risks nerve/vessel damage,Critical safety parameter
SAFETY - Angle safety,Keep needle perpendicular or slightly toward elbow - avoid angling palmward,Directional safety
SAFETY - Contraindications,"Local infection, severe bleeding disorders (relative)",Standard acupuncture contraindications
SAFETY - Special populations,Elderly: use 0.2-0.3 cun only; Children: very gentle technique; Pregnant: safe point,Population-specific adjustments
SAFETY - Needle stick prevention,"Use sharps container immediately, never recap needles",Universal precautions
ADVERSE EVENTS - Fainting (most common),Vasovagal response - have patient lie down before treatment,Prevention: always treat supine for first session
ADVERSE EVENTS - Minor bleeding,Apply pressure with cotton ball for 30-60 seconds,Usually resolves quickly
ADVERSE EVENTS - Bruising,"May occur if small vessel punctured - benign, resolves in days",Reassure patient - cosmetic only
ADVERSE EVENTS - Pain,Sharp pain = nerve contact - withdraw slightly and redirect,Adjust immediately
ADVERSE EVENTS - Stuck needle,"Muscle spasm holding needle - massage around area, wait, rotate gently",Rare at HT-7 due to location
COMBINATION - With Anmian,Bilateral HT-7 + bilateral Anmian = powerful sleep protocol,Evidence-based insomnia combination
COMBINATION - With PC-6,"HT-7 + PC-6 (same arm or bilateral) = calms Shen, opens chest",For anxiety-driven insomnia
COMBINATION - With SP-6,"HT-7 + SP-6 bilateral = RCT-proven combination, highest confidence","Nourishes Qi-Blood, calms Shen"
COMBINATION - With KI-3,"HT-7 + KI-3 = Heart-Kidney communication, chronic insomnia",2021 RCT showed improved PSQI/ISI scores
COMBINATION - With GV-20,HT-7 bilateral + GV-20 = comprehensive mind-body approach,Brain regulation + Spirit calming
BILATERAL/UNILATERAL - For insomnia,Use BILATERAL HT-7 (both wrists) for stronger effect,Standard approach for sleep disorders
BILATERAL/UNILATERAL - Unilateral option,Can use left HT-7 only (closer to Heart) if patient sensitive,Alternative for sensitive patients
BILATERAL/UNILATERAL - Technique,"Needle both sides using same technique, depth, manipulation",Symmetrical treatment
FREQUENCY - Acute insomnia,3 times per week for 2-3 weeks,Intensive initial phase
FREQUENCY - Chronic insomnia,2 times per week for 4-6 weeks,Sustained treatment
FREQUENCY - Maintenance,1 time per week or bi-weekly,After improvement achieved
FREQUENCY - Total course,Minimum 10 sessions recommended,Evidence-based treatment course
CLINICAL TIP 1,Always locate point with patient's hand relaxed in neutral position,Accurate point location
CLINICAL TIP 2,"For very deficient patients, minimal needle manipulation is sufficient - just insert and retain",Less is more for Qi deficiency
CLINICAL TIP 3,"If patient has cold hands, warm the area first with moxa or hands",Improves Qi circulation
CLINICAL TIP 4,Patient should NOT feel anxious during treatment - reduce stimulation if nervous,Treatment atmosphere matters
CLINICAL TIP 5,Document the exact depth and manipulation used for consistency in follow-up treatments,Clinical record keeping
CLINICAL TIP 6,HT-7 effect accumulates - patient may not sleep better first night but improves over sessions,Set realistic expectations
CLINICAL TIP 7,Can teach patients self-acupressure at HT-7 for home practice between sessions,Patient empowerment
